        <para>The HTTP Connection Pool Service is used internally by Repose for communicating to the origin service. 
            It is also used by the Distributed Datastore Service.  The HTTP Connection Pool Service is used by default 
            and does NOT need to be included in the System Model.  To customize http connection pooling defaults, an optional 
            http-connection-pool.cfg.xml can be provided.</para>
        <para>An example configuration is provided: Example Http Connection Pool Configuration. The schema (XSD) is located here: http-connection-pool.xsd</para>
        <para>Repose will use a default set of connection pool configurations, but these can be customized via an http-connection-pool.cfg.xml config file.</para>

                        use. Currently only 1 pool configuration is

                        <guilabel>keepalive.timeout</guilabel> - Some
                        HTTP servers use a non-standard Keep-Alive
                        header to communicate to the client the period
                        of time in seconds they intend to keep the
                        connection alive on the server side. If this
                        header is present in the response, the value
                        in this header will be used to determine the
                        maximum length of time to keep a persistent
                        connection open for. If the Keep-Alive header
                        is NOT present in the response, the value of
                        keepalive.timeout is evaluated. If this value
                        is 0, the connection will be kept alive
                        indefinitely. If the value is greater than 0,
                        the connection will be kept alive for the
                        number of milliseconds specified. </para>

                        (Repose v2.10) - Requests going through repose
                        have the possibility of having their request
                        bodies being modified by filters. Due to this
                        possibility Repose will, by default, send
                        requests with entities as chunked. Setting
                        'chunked-encoding' to false will cause Repose
                        to attempt to evaluate the actual content
                        length of the request by reading the Servlet
                        Input stream.</para>

                        <note>
                            <para>Reading the Servlet Input Stream
                                will allow Repose to send a
                                content-length header and not send
                                messages chunked. This will cause some
                                performance degradation as the request
                                body will now always be read as
                                instead to being streamed through.
