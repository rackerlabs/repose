        A single host definition that describes the host's ID,

        the host also hosts the service has no impact on how
        PowerAPI manages its components.

        is able to take advantage of this. For all other components

        service URI. What the href's presence tells PowerAPI is
        that this host is a service host. In the future there
        may be an attribute that explicitly defines whether or
        not the host really is a service host (i.e. where the
