    <description>
        The health check service is used to keep track of problems with repose.

        The reports are stored in a hash map. They keys of the map are UIDs, and the values are maps. The keys of those
        maps are RIDs (report IDs?) and the values are the HealthCheckReports.

        When registering a class to report issues, a UID is returned to use for that class. Once a UID is in hand, you
        can report issues for it by providing that UID, along with an RID and HealthCheckReport corresponding to
        the issue. When an issue is solved, solveIssue can be used on a specific report to clear it.

        isHealthy checks if the overall instance is working properly. There are also ways to get specific issue reports
        or a list of all the reports for a specific UID.

        This service also allows tracking of issue severity, which is encapsulated in the HealthCheckReport class.

        The HealthCheckServiceHelper provides a simpler API into the Health Check Service.

        An instance of the helper is built for a specific class, and you can then use reportIssue and resolveIssue
        to report and clear issues for that class.s
