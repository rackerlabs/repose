/**
 *
 * Provides an abstract class to be subclassed to create
 * an HTTP servlet suitable for a Web site. A subclass of
 * <code>HttpServlet</code> must override at least 
 * one method, usually one of these:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>doGet</code>, if the servlet supports HTTP GET requests
 * <li> <code>doPost</code>, for HTTP POST requests
 * <li> <code>doPut</code>, for HTTP PUT requests
 * <li> <code>doDelete</code>, for HTTP DELETE requests
 * <li> <code>init</code> and <code>destroy</code>, 
 * to manage resources that are held for the life of the servlet
 * <li> <code>getServletInfo</code>, which the servlet uses to
 * provide information about itself 
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There's almost no reason to override the <code>service</code>
 * method. <code>service</code> handles standard HTTP
 * requests by dispatching them to the handler methods
 * for each HTTP request type (the <code>do</code><i>XXX</i>
 * methods listed above).
 *
 * <p>Likewise, there's almost no reason to override the 
 * <code>doOptions</code> and <code>doTrace</code> methods.
 * 
 * <p>Servlets typically run on multithreaded servers,
 * so be aware that a servlet must handle concurrent
 * requests and be careful to synchronize access to shared resources.
 * Shared resources include in-memory data such as
 * instance or class variables and external objects
 * such as files, database connections, and network 
 * connections.
 * See the
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/Series/Tutorial/java/threads/multithreaded.html">
 * Java Tutorial on Multithreaded Programming</a> for more
 * information on handling multiple threads in a Java program.

    /**
     *
     * Called by the server (via the <code>service</code> method) to
     * allow a servlet to handle a GET request. 
     *
     * <p>Overriding this method to support a GET request also
     * automatically supports an HTTP HEAD request. A HEAD
     * request is a GET request that returns no body in the
     * response, only the request header fields.
     *
     * <p>When overriding this method, read the request data,
     * write the response headers, get the response's writer or 
     * output stream object, and finally, write the response data.
     * It's best to include content type and encoding. When using
     * a <code>PrintWriter</code> object to return the response,
     * set the content type before accessing the
     * <code>PrintWriter</code> object.
     *
     * <p>The servlet container must write the headers before
     * committing the response, because in HTTP the headers must be sent
     * before the response body.
     *
     * <p>Where possible, set the Content-Length header (with the
     * {@link javax.servlet.ServletResponse#setContentLength} method),
     * to allow the servlet container to use a persistent connection 
     * to return its response to the client, improving performance.
     * The content length is automatically set if the entire response fits
     * inside the response buffer.
     *
     * <p>When using HTTP 1.1 chunked encoding (which means that the response
     * has a Transfer-Encoding header), do not set the Content-Length header.
     *
     * <p>The GET method should be safe, that is, without
     * any side effects for which users are held responsible.
     * For example, most form queries have no side effects.
     * If a client request is intended to change stored data,
     * the request should use some other HTTP method.
     *
     * <p>The GET method should also be idempotent, meaning
     * that it can be safely repeated. Sometimes making a
     * method safe also makes it idempotent. For example, 
     * repeating queries is both safe and idempotent, but
     * buying a product online or modifying data is neither
     * safe nor idempotent. 
     *
     * <p>If the request is incorrectly formatted, <code>doGet</code>
     * returns an HTTP "Bad Request" message.
