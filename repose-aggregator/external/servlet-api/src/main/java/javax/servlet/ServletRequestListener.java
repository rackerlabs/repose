/**
 * Interface for receiving notification events about requests coming
 * into and going out of scope of a web application.
 *
 * <p>A ServletRequest is defined as coming into scope of a web
 * application when it is about to enter the first servlet or filter
 * of the web application, and as going out of scope as it exits
 * the last servlet or the first filter in the chain.
 *
 * <p>In order to receive these notification events, the implementation
 * class must be either declared in the deployment descriptor of the web
 * application, annotated with {@link javax.servlet.annotation.WebListener}, 
 * or registered via one of the addListener methods defined on
 * {@link ServletContext}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations of this interface are invoked at their
 * {@link #requestInitialized} method in the order in which they have been
 * declared, and at their {@link #requestDestroyed} method in reverse
 * order.
 *
 * @since Servlet 2.4
