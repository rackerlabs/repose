qvalue tests
------------

Description:
    "Take into account qvalue. So don't match against all X-Roles values but
    only those with highest qvalue. If the highest qvalue is 0.9, and two
    values have that qvalue, use those two to compare against @role, and no
    others."

Notation:
    When a role designation is followed by a 'q' and a number, that indicates
    the qvalue that the associated header value will have when sent to Repose.
    For example, '1q0.5' translates into 'X-Roles: role-1; q=0.5'. If no 'q'
    and no number are given, then no 'q=' will be added to the header, and the
    qvalue will assume the HTTP default of 1


We want to ensure that the filter is using the role(s) with highest qvalue, and
discarding all others. To do this, we define a few validator configs and send
requests with roles of various qvalues:

    f4f5p\1q0.1,3q0.9 -> p
    mf4p\1q0.9,2q0.1 -> f4

If qvalues were ignored, then the first test would result in an f4, and the
second would result in a pass.

We also want to check that the filter is picking all roles that share the
highest qvalue, instead of just the first one it finds.

    f4f5p\3q0.9,2q0.1,1q0.9 -> f4

Both role-1 and role-3 will have q=0.9, and role-2 should be discarded. If the
filter just uses the first role-3 value, then it will result in a pass. If it
uses both role-1 and role-3, then it will result in an f4.
