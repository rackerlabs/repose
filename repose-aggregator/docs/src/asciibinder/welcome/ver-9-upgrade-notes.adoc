= Upgrade to Version 9 from Version 8 Notes

== Core Behavior Changes
. Headers will no longer be split unnecessarily at the boundaries of *Repose*.
  If you were counting on this behavior for some reason see <<../recipes/header-splitting.adoc#, Pre 9.0 Header Splitting>>.
. The response status line reason phrase from the origin service will now be forwarded from the origin service.
  If you were expecting *Repose* to normalize the reason phrase, see the <<../recipes/reason-phrase-normalization.adoc#, Reason Phrase Normalization recipe>>.
. Requests can now contain headers with empty values.
  For example, if *Repose* receives a request with the header line `My-Header: `, that header line will now be forwarded to the origin service.

== System Model Configuration
. Support for multi-cluster deployments has been removed.
.. The `cluster` element was removed from the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#, system model>>.
   Remember that a cluster is just a logical grouping of nodes by their functionality, and as such, logical clusters can still be constructed outside of *Repose*.
... *Repose* clusters are no longer supported.
    Instead, an operator will need to define *Repose* behavior per-node.
    In other words, each *Repose* cluster will become a new <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#, system model>> configuration.
    To route a request between *Repose* nodes, see the following bullet.
... Service clusters (via round-robin routing) are no longer supported.
    Instead, an operator may choose to use a router to route traffic between destinations with identical functionality.
    A route could be anything from a physical F5 Load Balancer to a Cloud Load Balancer to an OpenShift service.

== Container Configuration
. The `via` attribute was removed from the <<../architecture/container.adoc#, container configuration>>.
  It has been replaced with the `via-header` element.
  To replicate the previous behavior set the value that was previously in the `via` attribute in the `request-prefix` and `response-prefix` attributes of the new element.

== Deployment
. Support for installing *Repose* into an existing container has been dropped. For help moving to another deployment see <<../recipes/valve-installation.adoc, Valve Installation>> and <<../recipes/quick-start.adoc, Quick Start with Docker>>.
. The package for valve installation has changed from `repose-valve` to `repose`.

== HTTP Client/Connection Pool Service
. If setting the `chunked-encoding` attribute, it will no longer be set in <<../services/http-client.adoc#configuration, HTTP Client Service configuration>> but instead will be set in the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#configuration, System Model configuration>>.
.. Deprecated configuration values have been removed; change `0` to `false` and `1` to `true`.

== Rackspace Auth User, SAML Policy Translation, and Attribute Mapping Policy Validation Filters
. Consult with identity for where these filters now live.

== Header Normalization Filter
. All matching targets will now be processed, previously only the first target that matched would be evaluated.

== URL Extractor to Header Filter
. All capture groups in the URL regex will now add their captured values to the desired header.
.. If you have configured a URL regex with multiple capture groups but do not desire the values of some of those groups to be added to the header, use the non-capturing group construct (i.e., `(?:X)`).
   See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#special[the special constructs portion of the Java Pattern documentation] for more information.

== OpenStack Identity v3 Filter
. Removed deprecated caching attributes:
.. `token-cache-timeout` on the `openstack-identity-v3` element; `token` on the `timeouts` element should be used instead.
.. `groups-cache-timeout` on the `openstack-identity-v3` element; `group` on the `timeouts` element should be used instead.
.. `cache-offset` on the `openstack-identity-v3` element; `variance` on the `timeouts` element should be used instead.

== Keystone v2 and Keystone v2 Authorization Filters
. The `uri-tenant-quality` attribute was removed; the `validated-tenant-quality` should be used in its place.
. Support for extracting required tenant ID(s) from the URI was removed from the <<../filters/keystone-v2-authorization.adoc#, Keystone v2 Authorization Filter>> and <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 Filter>> configuration.
  To continue validating tenant ID(s) from the URI, follow these steps:
.. Add the <<../filters/url-extractor-to-header.adoc#, URL Extractor to Header Filter>> to your <<../architecture/filter-chain.adoc#, Filter Chain>> in the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#, System Model>>.
.. Configure the <<../filters/url-extractor-to-header.adoc#, URL Extractor to Header Filter>> to extract tenant ID(s) to a new header.
... For example, if your <<../filters/keystone-v2-authorization.adoc#, Keystone v2 Authorization Filter>> or <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 Filter>> was configured with:
+
[source,xml]
----
<uri-extraction-regex>.*/servers/([:\-\w]+)/?.*</uri-extraction-regex>
----
+
Then you would configure the <<../filters/url-extractor-to-header.adoc#, URL Extractor to Header Filter>> with:
+
[source,xml]
----
<extraction url-regex=".*/servers/([:-\w]+)/?.*" header="X-Expected-Tenant"/>
----
.. Replace usage of the `uri-extraction-regex` element with the `header-extraction-name` element in your <<../filters/keystone-v2-authorization.adoc#, Keystone v2 Authorization Filter>> and <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 Filter>> configuration.
... The value of the `header-extraction-name` element should match the value of the header name configured in the <<../filters/url-extractor-to-header.adoc#, URL Extractor to Header Filter>>.
... Following the previous example, the configured header name would be `X-Expected-Tenant`.
Therefore, the <<../filters/keystone-v2-authorization.adoc#, Keystone v2 Authorization Filter>> or <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 Filter>> configuration should contain:
+
[source,xml]
----
<header-extraction-name>X-Expected-Tenant</header-extraction-name>
----

== For Integrators

. The `ServiceClient` utility has been removed.
  The <<../services/http-client.adoc#, HTTP Client Service>> clients should be used instead.
. The `HttpComponentFactory` utility has been removed.
  Apache's HTTP client `RequestBuilder` should be used instead.

=== HTTP Client/Connection Pool Service
. The following methods have been removed from the HTTP Client Service API and should no longer be used:
.. `releaseClient`
.. `isAvailable`
.. `getAvailableClients`
.. `shutdown`

=== Akka HTTP Client Service
. This service has been removed.
  Functionality has been migrated to the <<../services/http-client.adoc#, HTTP Client Service>>.

.. `org.openrepose.core.ResponseCode.Repose.<statusCode>`
.. `org.openrepose.core.ResponseCode.<location>.<statusCodeClass>`
.. `org.openrepose.core.ResponseTime.Repose.<statusCode>`
.. `org.openrepose.core.ResponseTime.<location>.<statusCodeClass>`
