= Rate Limiting Filter

The Rate Limiting filter can be used to limit the number of requests that make it through *Repose* to specified resources belonging to the origin service.
By imposing a rate limit, an operator can prevent the origin service from being flooded by requests, thereby bounding the potential for congestion or contention.

Additionally, this filter can expose rate limiting data by allowing users to query rate limits.
With accessible rate limiting data, a user can determine the number of requests they are allowed to make per period of time to various resources.

See <<Additional Information>> for more details on how rate limiting is performed.

== General Filter Information
* *Name:* rate-limiting
* *Default Configuration:* rate-limiting.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v1.0
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/rate-limiting-configuration.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
* `X-PP-User` - Supplies a unique identifier for the user making the request.
If the request matches a limit, the request count associated with this identifier will be incremented.
* *(Optional)* `X-PP-Groups` - Supplies one or more identifier for the limit group(s) that the user belongs to.

[NOTE]
.Quality Factor
====
This filter uses the quality parameter of header values to determine the user and group(s) provided in the request.
The value(s) with the highest quality will be used, while all other values will be ignored.
In the case of the `X-PP-User` header, only the first of the highest quality values will be used.

This is useful when an operator desires to employ multiple authentication/identity mechanisms.
====

=== Required Preceding Filters
Strictly speaking, there is not a hard requirement for any filter to precede this filter.
However, it is *strongly recommended* to utilize the following filters ahead of this filter.

* <<uri-normalization.adoc#, URI Normalization Filter>> - Normalizes the URI so that limits' `uri-regex` match reliably, and capture groups work consistently.
Normalization helps prevent cache busting that may occur due to the various possible encodings of the URI.
In other words, normalization will lead to `/servers/abc/instances/123` and `/servers/abc/instances/%31%32%33` being handled identically.
* User Identity Filter - Populates the `X-PP-User` and `X-PP-Groups` headers described in <<Required Headers>>.
Any of the following filters can be used to fulfill this role:
** <<ip-user.adoc#, IP User Filter>>
** <<header-user.adoc#, Header User Filter>>
** <<uri-user.adoc#, URI User Filter>>
** <<keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 Filter>>
** <<openstack-identity-v3.adoc#, OpenStack Identity v3 Filter>>

=== Request Headers Created
* `Accept` - Only modified if this filter is configured with a `request-endpoint`, `include-absolute-limits` is enabled, and the request was made to the `request-endpoint`.
The value of this header will be `application/xml`.

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not strictly required by any other filters.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter will only modify the response body if this filter is configured with a `request-endpoint`.
In that case, in response to requests made to the `request-endpoint`, this filter will populate the response body with details of the current state of limits which apply to the provided user with the provided group(s).

See <<Querying Limits>> for more details.

=== Response Headers Created
* `Retry-After` - Only created if the user is rate limited.
The value of this header will be a date after which the user can send another request without being rate limited.
* `Content-Type` - Only created if this filter is configured with a `request-endpoint`, and the request was made to the `request-endpoint`.
The value of this header will be the preferred media type provided in the `Accept` header of the request.

=== Response Status Codes
[cols="2,a", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Status Code
| Reasons

| `200`
|
* If the response to a request to the `request-endpoint` is sent successfully.

| `401`
|
* If the `X-PP-User` header is not present on the request.

| `406`
|
* If the `Accept` header on a request to the `request-endpoint` does not indicate that the user supports `application/xml` or `application/json`.

| `413`
|
* If the user is rate limited and `overLimit-429-responseCode` is set to false.

| `429`
|
* If the user is rate limited and `overLimit-429-responseCode` is set to true.

| `500`
|
* If an unexpected issue arises.

| `502`
|
* If there is an issue obtaining absolute limits from the origin service.
* If there is an issue committing an updated limit across nodes when using a <<../services/datastores.adoc#, distributed datastore>>.

| `503`
|
* If the filter has not yet initialized.
* If a global rate limit is reached.
* If a <<../services/datastores.adoc#, distributed datastore>> action fails.

== Additional Information

=== Limit Groups
A limit group is just a group containing one or more limit(s).
The motivation behind limit groups is to provide a way of applying different limits to different types of users.
The limits that will be applied to the request are the limits in the limit group configured with a `group` that matches a value in the `X-PP-Groups` header.
If no limit group matches the request, the default limit group will be used.

When a limit in a group is reached, succeeding limits within the same limit group will never be applied.
In other words, the most restrictive limit will prevent updates to succeeding limits.
Preceding limits within the group will continue to apply (i.e., continue to increment).

[NOTE]
====
Only the limits in the first limit group to match the request are applied.
====

=== Limits
A limit is the number of requests per unit of time that are allowed to pass through *Repose*.
Limits are applied selectively to requests matching certain criteria such as a request's HTTP method and query parameters.
Multiple rate limits that match the same request will all apply.
A limit is reached when a user has sent a number of requests equal to the value of the limit within the span of one unit (configurable on the limit) of time.
If a limit has been reached, this filter will prevent requests from passing through *Repose*.
If a limit has not been reached, the request will pass through this filter.
Limits will reset after the configured unit of time has passed.

==== Global Limits
Global limits are very similar to normal <<Limits>>, except that they are applied to all requests, irrespective of the user making the request.
That is, global limits can protect the end service as a whole rather than just from individual users.
For example, if a service is known to only handle up to 500 requests per second in total, a global rate limit can be set to 500 requests per second to prevent further requests from reaching and compromising the origin service.
Any request which breaks that limit will receive a response with status code 503.

[NOTE]
====
Global limits are not currently queryable via the `request-endpoint`.
====

=== Time Block Algorithm
This is the algorithm used to determine whether or not a limit has been reached.
In this algorithm, a time unit is considered discrete and independent from other units.
Therefore, only requests that occur during such a time unit are counted towards the limit.
Once the end of a time unit is reached, the count toward a limit will be reset.
This is in contrast to a leaky bucket rate limit, wherein time units are continuous.

It is important to note that, with this approach, it is possible that `2x - 1` (where x is the configured limit value) requests will pass through this filter over the period of one time unit.
If that occurs, however, fewer requests will be allowed to pass through surrounding time units.
Which is to say that, on average, the configured rate limit of `x` will be enforced.

Consider the following example.
Five requests are allowed per minute for each time-block, but the one-minute window that lands in between the two units has seven requests.
This shows that limits may be broken for a given window of time, however, across multiple units of time, the allowed requests average less than or equal to five requests per minute.

=== Querying Limits
This filter tracks limits by user, and consequently, requires a user be provided when querying limits.
The exception is global limits, however, since global limits are not currently query-able, they will be omitted from this explanation.
To query a limit, a `GET` request should be made to the `request-endpoint`.
If no `request-endpoint` is defined, then querying limits is not possible.
As always, requests must include the `X-PP-User` header, and may include the `X-PP-Groups` header.
The limit details returned from the `request-endpoint` will be for the limits in the limit group that matches a provided group as they apply to the provided user.

The limit details themselves will be presented in either XML or JSON format.
If no `Accept` header is present on the request, or if the `Accept` header has no value, the JSON format will be returned as the default.
Otherwise, the returned format will be determined based on the `Accept` header specification defined in link:https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html[Section 14 of RFC 2616].
If the limit query request does not accept at least one of the supported media types, a 406 response will be returned.

Take a look at the <<Querying Limits Example>> to see this feature in action!

==== Absolute Limits
The set of absolute limits is comprised of the set of limits defined in this filter's configuration and the limits imposed by the origin service.
These limits will only be returned if `include-absolute-limits` on the `request-endpoint` is set to true.
Otherwise, only the limits defined in this filter's configuration will be returned.

[NOTE]
====
To retrieve limits from a origin service, a request will be made through the *Repose* filter chain to the origin service.
====

=== Distributed Datastore

If a <<../services/datastores.adoc#, distributed datastore>> is used, a partition event may leave some rate limiting data inaccessible.
If and when such an event occurs, rate limits may not be tracked or handled with perfect accuracy.
In nearly all cases, availability is chosen over consistency to allow *Repose* to continue serving requests even if it comes at the cost of inaccurate rate limits.
In short, while rate limits will still be tracked and enforced, networking failures can cause more requests than desired to be passed to the origin service.
