= OpenAPI Validator Filter

The OpenAPI Validator Filter validates requests against a configured https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI Document].

The OpenAPI document describes an API, detailing how to make requests and what form the responses will take.
If a request fails validation against the OpenAPI document, this filter will reject the request.
For example, if the OpenAPI document requires a query parameter for a particular operation and the request for that operation is missing the query parameter, this filter will discontinue processing of the request and send an error response.

== General filter information
* *Name:* openapi-validator

* *Released:* 9.0.1.0
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* link:../schemas/openapi-validator.xsd[Schema]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
Vary based on configuration.

This filter itself does not require any request headers, however the configured OpenAPI document may.

=== Required Preceding Filters
<<keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 filter>> is recommended when doing Role Based Access Control.

=== Request Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any request headers.

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not a dependency of any other filter.

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes

.Status Codes
|===
| Status Code
| Reasons

| `400`
a| * The OpenAPI document does not specify a request body, but the request contains a body.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a request body, but the request does not contain a body.
   * The OpenAPI document specifies a security scheme, but the request does not contain data required by that scheme.
   * The OpenAPI document specifies a security scheme, but the request does not meet the requirements of that scheme.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a request header, but the request does not contain that header.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a query parameter, but the request does not contain that query parameter.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a parameter, but the request does not contain that parameter.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a parameter with a value from an enumerated set, but the parameter value from the request does not exist in the set.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a single parameter value, but the request contains multiple parameter values.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a maximum number of parameter values, but the request parameter contains more values than that number.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a minimum number of parameter values, but the request parameter contains fewer values than that number.
   * The OpenAPI document requires a parameter with only unique values, but the request parameter contains duplicate values.
   * The request contains a `Content-Type` header with an invalid value.
   * The request contains an `Accept` header with an invalid value.
   * The OpenAPI document requires JSON content, but the request contains invalid JSON content.
   * A validation failure that is not explicitly expected has occurred.

| `401`
a| * The OpenAPI document specifies a role and none of the provided roles match.

| `404`
a| * The OpenAPI document does not contain a path matching the path of the request.

| `405`
a| * The OpenAPI document does not contain an operation matching the method of the request.

| `406`
a| * The OpenAPI document does not contain a response content mapping for the media type(s) specified by the `Accept` header of the request.

| `415`
a| * The OpenAPI document does not contain a request content mapping for the media type(s) specified by the `Content-Type` header of the request.

| `500`
a| * An error occurs while attempting to read the request.
   * An unexpected error occurs while this filter is processing.
   * An unknown error occurs while validating schema from the OpenAPI document against the request.

== Role Based Access Control
For convenience an extension is provided that does role checking when used in combination with the <<keystone-v2.adoc#, Keystone v2 filter>>.
This is enable through the extension mechanism of *Swagger/OpenApi* under the element name `x-rax-roles`.

[source, yaml]
.partial api-spec.yml
----
paths:
  /pets:
    get:
      summary: List all pets
      operationId: listPets
      x-rax-roles: ["user", "admin"]  <1>
----
<1> The array of role names that are acceptable. This value must be an array even if it contains a single value.

The values contained in the request `X-Roles` header will be compared against the configured list, if any match the request is considered valid.

[NOTE]
====
This is just a convenience, the same thing could be acheived by doing a header check in the api specification.

== Examples
=== OpenAPI Request Validation
This configuration will validate inbound requests against an OpenAPI document.

[source, xml]
.openapi-validator.cfg.xml
----
<openapi-validator xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/openapivalidator/v1.0"
                   href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/3.0.2/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml"/> <!--1-->
----
<1> A URL which specifies where the OpenAPI document to use for validation is located and how to access it.  +
    This reference can be either local or remote, absolute or relative. +
    If relative, this reference will be resolved as a file in the *Repose* configuration root directory. +
    Scheme (e.g., `http:`, `file:`) support is determined by the JVM running this filter.

== Additional Information
This filter is backed by the https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/swagger-request-validator[Swagger Request Validator] library.
As such, the validations supported by this filter are exactly those supported by that library.

=== Validation Failure Priority
If a request fails validation due to more than one issue, the issue with the highest priority will be used to set the response status code and reason.

The following list provides all request validation issues handled by this filter in priority order (i.e., issues higher on the list will be used over issues lower on the list):

. Path missing
. Method not allowed
. Unexpected body
. Missing body
. Missing security
. Invalid security
. Missing header
. Missing query
. Missing parameter
. Invalid enum parameter
. Invalid parameter collection
. Invalid parameter collection format
. Parameter collection contains too many items
. Parameter collection contains too few items
. Parameter collection contains duplicate items
. Invalid content type
. Content type not allowed
. Invalid accept type
. Accept type not allowed
. Invalid JSON content
. Unknown schema validation problem
. Any other validation failure
