= Highly Efficient Record Processor (HERP) Filter

The Highly Efficient Record Processor (HERP) filter logs an event for each API request.
These logs provide information regarding the processing of each request.
The logs can be inspected to view the usage of a service and to perform auditing.
Events are recorded even if the API request is rejected by *Repose* before reaching the origin service.

== General Filter Information
* *Name:* herp
* *Released:* v7.0.0.1
* *Bundle:* repose-filter-bundle
* *Default Configuration:* highly-efficient-record-processor.cfg.xml
* *Configuration Schema:* link:../schemas/highly-efficient-record-processor.xsd[highly-efficient-record-processor.xsd]

== Prerequisites & Postconditions
=== Required Request Headers
[cols="15,12,73", options="header"]
.Response
|===
| Response Headers
| Value
| Conditions of Requirement

| `X-User-Name`
| Username of the requestor
| Required when the username was not provided in the request (e.g., for change password requests to Identity using a temporary token)
|===

=== Required Preceding Filters
This filter has no dependencies on other filters and can be placed wherever it is needed in the filter chain.

[CAUTION]
====
In order for the HERP filter to process and record every request, no preceding filter in the filter chain may write a response.
To prevent short-circuiting without changing behavior, delegation has been added to many *Repose* filters.
See <<../recipes/delegation.adoc#,Delegation in Repose>> for more details.
====

=== Request Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any request headers.

=== Request Body Changes
This filter does not modify the request body.

=== Recommended Follow-On (Succeeding) Filters
This filter is not strictly required by any other filters.
However, the DeRP filter commonly follows the HERP filter.

[CAUTION]
====
The HERP filter will not process responses sent from preceding filters.
The DeRP filter can be used to perform delegation.
Place the DeRP filter after the HERP filter so that responses sent by any preceding filters are delegated.
====

=== Response Body Changes
This filter does not modify the response body.

=== Response Headers Created
This filter does not create/modify any response headers.

=== Response Status Codes
This filter does not modify the response code.

== Examples
To use the HERP filter, you need to:

. Edit the `highly-efficient-record-processor.cfg.xml` file.
. Add the HERP filter to your system model.
. Configure the logger-name attribute to note the SLF4j logger
. Configure the service-code attribute to note the service being accessed.
. Configure the region attribute to note the region of the service.
. Configure the data-center attribute to note the data center of the service.
. Configure the template element to define the format of the messages to be logged by the HERP filter.

=== Optional User-Configurable Filtering
The HERP filter allows user-configurable filtering along with optional pre and post log identifiers.

Each `filterOut` block contains all of the criteria required for a single filter.
If any of the individual criterion in the `match` elements contained within a `filterOut` element fail, then that filter fails and it goes on to evaluate the next one.
If any of the `filterOut` blocks fully match, then the event is filtered and not logged to the post-filter log.
In other words, the `match` elements are logically AND'd and the `filterOut` blocks are logically OR'd.

. Within the match element:
 * Set the `field` attribute to name the event field to be matched.
   If the `field` is a map (e.g., parameters), then a dot separates the `field` from the map key and both are placed in the `field` attribute.
 * Set the `regex` attribute to determine if the regular expressions match the fields' values.
   The regex is currently considered to match if any part of a field's value matches.
   For example, a regex of `"racker"` would match a value of `"rackerTwo"`.
   To strictly match, use a more explicit regex such as `"^racker$"`.
. Optionally, you can:
 * Specify a `pre-filter-logger-name` that logs all events to it prior to performing any filter logic.
 * Specify a `post-filter-logger-name` that logs all events to it that are not filtered out.

== Additional Information
=== Optional User-Configurable Filtering
The HERP filter allows user-configurable filtering along with optional pre and post log identifiers.

Each `filterOut` block contains all of the criteria required for a single filter.
If any of the individual criterion in the `match` elements contained within a `filterOut` element fail, then that filter fails and it goes on to evaluate the next one.
If any of the `filterOut` blocks fully match, then the event is filtered and not logged to the post-filter log.
In other words, the `match` elements are logically AND'd and the `filterOut` blocks are logically OR'd.

. Within the match element:
 * Set the `field` attribute to name the event field to be matched.
   If the `field` is a map (e.g., parameters), then a dot separates the `field` from the map key and both are placed in the `field` attribute.
 * Set the `regex` attribute to determine if the regular expressions match the fields' values.
   The regex is currently considered to match if any part of a field's value matches.
   For example, a regex of `"racker"` would match a value of `"rackerTwo"`.
   To strictly match, use a more explicit regex such as `"^racker$"`.
. Optionally, you can:
 * Specify a `pre-filter-logger-name` that logs all events to it prior to performing any filter logic.
 * Specify a `post-filter-logger-name` that logs all events to it that are not filtered out.

=== User Access Event Recording With Flume
For information about using the Flume with the HERP filter for user access event recording, see <<../recipes/api-event-flume.adoc#,CF Flume Sink>> for more details.

=== Configurable Parameters
In the `template` element, certain template keys may be used to add dynamic content to the text being logged.
Any valid key enclosed in brackets (i.e., `{{<key>}}`) will be replaced, brackets included, by the value associated with that key at runtime.
Note that key names are case sensitive.
A list of supported keys follows:

[cols="3", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Supported fields     | Description                                                                                                                        | Prerequisite Filter(s)
| clusterId            | The cluster ID of the *Repose* node on which the filter is running, configured in the *Repose* system model.                           | -
| dataCenter           | The data center, configured in the highly-efficient-record-processor.cfg.xml file.
                         This string will be used in logging to note the data center of the service.                                                        | -
| guid	               | A globally unique identifier generated for a particular request.
                         This will begin with the value provided in the Tracing header (X-Trans-Id) if present and be followed by a colon (`:`) and a GUID. | -
| impersonatorName     | The impersonator making the request on behalf of a user.                                                                           | client-auth *or* openstack-identity-v3
| methodLabel          | A label which describes the API call.
                         This is pulled from the WADL used by the api-validator filter.                                                                     | api-validator
| nodeId               | The node ID of the *Repose* node on which the filter is running, configured in the *Repose* system model.	                            | -
| parameters           | The query parameters for a request.
                         Note that this field is a map, and specific parameters can be inserted using the following form: `{{parameters.<parameter-key>}}`. | -
| projectID            | The tenant ID or project ID of the user making the request authenticated through an OpenStack Identity service.
                         Note that, if the client-auth filter is used, the `tenantId` from that filter will be inserted into this field.
                         IF the origin service will add this header to the response, THEN that will be used if not available on the request.                | client-auth *or* openstack-identity-v3
                                                                                                                                                              (`X-Tenant-ID` *or* `X-Project-ID`)

| requestQueryString   | The full query string of the request.
                         For example, a request to /path?a=1&b=1 would have a query string of a=1&b=2.	                                                    | -
| requestURL	       | The URL of the request.	                                                                                                        | -

| responseCode	       | The response code to be returned to the user.	                                                                                    | -
| responseMessage	   | The response message to be returned to the user.
                         This is not the body of the response.                                                                                              | -

| serviceCode          | The service code, configured in the highly-efficient-record-processor.cfg.xml file.
                         This string will be used in logging to describe the service being accessed.                                                        | -
| targetHost           | The host portion of the request.                                                                                                   | -
| timestamp            | A timestamp indicating when the HERP filter processed the request.                                                                 | -
| userAgent            | The user agent of the request.                                                                                                     | -
| userName	           | The username of the user making the request. | client-auth *or* openstack-identity-v3
|===

The HERP filter also provides helper functions to the templating engine.
These helpers work like the keys above, but take some input.
For example, assuming the HTTP request method is a `GET`, `{{cadfMethod requestMethod}}` would be replace by `"read/get"`.
The following helpers are available:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Supported helpers          | Description
| cadfOutcome <responseCode> | Converts a HTTP response code into either "success" or "failure".
| cadfTimestamp <timestamp>  | Converts a timestamp into the CADF format.
| cadfMethod <requestMethod> | Converts a HTTP method into the CADF format.

=== Recommendation For Managing Disk Space
If you expect heavy usage, you should use a logging tool, such as link:http://logstash.net/[Logstash], for managing events and logs and should not write events to files.
Even if you rely on auditing, it is not recommended that you use the file system with the audit logs.
*Repose* has developed <<../recipes/api-event-flume.adoc#,CF Flume Sink>> to eliminate disk space and log file issues.
