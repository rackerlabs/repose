= Datastores

*Repose* uses one of the following datastore implementations to store various types of data:

* Local datastore (name: local/default)
* Distributed datastore (name: distributed/hash-ring)

The local datastore is enabled by default.
The others are enabled by including the appropriate service into your <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#,System Model>> configuration.

== Local Datastore
If no other datastores are configured, then *Repose* will use the local datastore.
The local datastore will store data using the cache on each node.
Data will not be shared among the nodes, so each *Repose* node will have its own copy of the data.
For example, if using rate limiting with the local datastore, then each node will track its own limit information and limit updates will not be shared with other nodes.

== Distributed Datastore
A *Repose* node may, at times, need to share information with other *Repose* nodes.
The Distributed Datastore component allows *Repose* to host a simple hash-ring object store that shares consistency between all of the participating nodes.
This, in turn, allows other hosted components as well as external programs to use a cluster of *Repose* nodes as a whole to store information.
Instead of cache operations communicating through the *Repose* Service port (which is the port a *Repose* instance services requests to pass to the Origin Service), the Distributed Datastore Service will communicate through configured port(s) within the distributed datastore configuration.
If the Distributed Datastore Service is unable to communicate with the service on other nodes, it will fall back on the local datastore temporarily.
Once other nodes become reachable, the Distributed Datastore Service will return to being distributed.

=== Configuration
* *Default Configuration:* dist-datastore.cfg.xml
* *Released:* v2.7.0
* link:../schemas/dist-datastore.xsd[Schema]

The Distributed Datastore service can be enabled in a *Repose* deployment by adding it to the services list of the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#,System Model>> like this:
[source,xml]
.system-model.cfg.xml (partial)
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<system-model xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/system-model/v2.0">
  ...
  <services>
    <service name="dist-datastore"/>
  </services>
  ...
</system-model>
----

Adding the Distributed Datastore Service to a *Repose* deployment requires that listening ports be configured within the `dist-datastore.cfg.xml` file.
The `<port>` element is the port configuration for the Distributed Datastore.
When you configure *Repose* to start with the Distributed Datastore, the running *Repose* instance will try to find the `<port>` configuration that matches it's own node ID in the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#,System Model>>.
If the `node` attribute is not defined for a `<port>`, that `<port>` is considered the default `<port>`.
A running *Repose* instance will listen on the default `<port>` for Distributed Datastore traffic if no `<port>` is defined with a `node` attribute matching its own node ID in the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#,System Model>>.

The following is a basic sample configuration.
[source,xml]
.dist-datastore.cfg.xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<distributed-datastore xmlns='http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/distributed-datastore/v1.0'>
    <allowed-hosts allow-all="true"/>
    <port-config>
        <port port="9999"/>
    </port-config>

=== Security
The distributed datastore provides the option to encrypt communication between nodes using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
As mentioned above, this is achieved by configuring a keystore in the `dist-datastore.cfg.xml` file.
This feature can additionally provide client authentication during the SSL handshake.
By both validating the client credentials and encrypting communication with the client, data in the datastore is made more secure.

Assuming all *Repose* nodes are configured identically, the most straight-forward way to make use of this security would be to use a single unique keystore as both the keystore and the truststore.
This can be achieved by not explicitly configuring a separate truststore.
Since each datastore node will have a copy of the keystore, each node will trust every other node.

Client authentication in SSL/TLS can act as as alternate form of client validation, performing a task similar to that of an access control list.
As such, the usage of client authentication may replace the need to configure the allowed-hosts section of the `dist-datastore.cfg.xml` file.

The distributed datastore will use a connection pool from the <<http-client.adoc#,HTTP Client Service>> to communicate across nodes.
If a connection pool is not configured, the default will be used.
In nearly all cases, the connection pool being used should not be the default, but rather, a connection pool should be configured to use <<../recipes/client-authentication.adoc#, SSL/TLS Client Authentication>> configured in the distributed datastore.
That is, the distributed datastore may be thought of as a server, and clients in the connection pool as clients.
Both the client and server need to be aware of how to communicate, and so they both must be configured with the appropriate secrets.

For managing keystores and truststores, the aptly named keytool can be used.

=== Distribution
The distributed datastore shares key-space with all of the enabled cluster nodes.
Key-space is determined by the maximum value of the distributed datastore's hashing algorithm.
Currently the only supported hashing algorithm is MD5.

=== Key-space Addressing
Addressing a key is done by first normalizing all of the participating cluster nodes.
This is done by an ascending sort.
After the participating nodes have had their order normalized, the key-space is sliced up by dividing the maximum possible number of addresses by the total number of participating nodes.
The given key is then reduced to its numeric representation and a cluster node is looked up by performing a modulus such that (`<key-value> % <number-of-cluster-members>`).

=== Key-space Encoding
By default, the internal *Repose* client implementation for the distributed datastore will obscure key-space by storing only the MD5 hash value of a given key and not the key's actual value.
This is important to note since external gets against the distributed datastore must be aware of this functionality.
The MD5 hash is represented as a 128bit UUID.

Example Key Addressing

* String Key: `object-key`
* MD5 Hash: `cd26615a30a3cdce02e3a834fed5711a`
* UUID: `cecda330-5a61-26cd-1a71-d5fe34a8e302`

If an external application makes a request for data stored by *Repose* components, it must first hash the key using MD5 before sending the request such that...

`GET /powerapi/dist-datastore/objects/object-key`

becomes

`GET /powerapi/dist-datastore/objects/cecda330-5a61-26cd-1a71-d5fe34a8e302`

Obscuring key-space is not a function of the distributed datastore service.
This functionality is only present in the internally consumed java cache client.
If an external application puts an object into the distributed datastore, the object will be stored under the value of the key given.

=== Remote Management
The repose distributed datastore component is a service that hosts a simple RESTful API that can be contacted to perform remote object store operations.
These operations are defined below.

`GET /powerapi/dist-datastore/objects/<object-key> HTTP/1.1`

Gets a stored object from the datastore by its key.

`PUT /powerapi/dist-datastore/objects/<object-key> HTTP/1.1`

Puts an object into the datastore by its key.

`DELETE /powerapi/dist-datastore/objects/<object-key> HTTP/1.1`

Deletes an object from the datastore by its key.

`PATCH /powerapi/dist-datastore/objects/<object-key> HTTP/1.1`

Patches an object in the datastore by its key.
If the object does not exist, then a new one created.
Return the modified/new object.
The object must be Patchable.

=== Remote Fail-Over
In the event that a node with in a datastore cluster falls off line or is unable to respond to requests, it is removed from the node's cluster membership for a period of time.
During this time, the online node will then re-address its key-space in order to continue operation.
After certain periods of rest, the node may attempt to introduce the damaged cluster member into its cluster membership.
A damaged cluster member must go through several validation passes where the member is introduced back into the addressing algorithm before it can be considered online.
In order to keep healthy nodes from attempting to route requests to the damaged node, a participating node may tell it's destination that the destination may not route the request and must handle the value locally.

=== Performance
The *Repose* node will open sockets each time it has to communicate with other *Repose* nodes to share information.
During times of load this can affect performance and data integrity as when one node cannot communicate with another it will mark that node damaged and store/create information locally.
One way this can happen is if the user running repose hits their open file limit.
Luckily this can be mitigated by increasing the open file limit for the user running *Repose*.

=== JMX Reporting
Currently *Repose* instances do not report Distributed Datastore information to JMX.
This is something that has been done in the past, but an upgrade to the metrics library used has made this capability incompatible with the current codebase.
