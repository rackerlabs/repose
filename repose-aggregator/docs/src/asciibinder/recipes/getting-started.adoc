== What is Repose?
*Repose* is an open-source, RESTful middleware platform that transparently integrates with your existing infrastructure.
Technically, it is a pseudo-transparent reverse proxy.

*Repose* provides highly scalable, extensible solutions to common API processing tasks including authentication, rate limiting, access control, logging, and more.

Additionally, *Repose* allows services to use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Integration_Patterns[Enterprise Integration Patterns].

== How Does Repose Work?
*Repose* takes incoming requests from clients and adjusts them for consumption by services by passing the requests through a series of extensible filters.
These filters provide functionality such as authentication, authorization, rate-limiting, and request modification.
*Repose* can run as a stand-alone proxy server between the client and the origin service.
The *Repose* instance can be on the same host as the origin service, but it doesn't have to be.
This deployment method, illustrated in the following graphic, is called <<valve-installation.adoc#,Valve>>.

You can decide which configuration works best for you, and you can tweak many of your configurations without having to restart *Repose* â€“ it will pick up configuration changes on the fly, making it easy to configure and test.

*Repose* can be configured to use a distributed data store where cached information is exchanged across multiple nodes.
This makes *Repose* fault tolerant with proven performance.

== What Services Does Repose Provide?
*Repose* provides a series of customizable filters that you can configure to perform a large number of API tasks.
The full list of filters is on the <<../filters/index.adoc#,Filters>> page.
Following are some of the most common ones:

* <<../filters/translation.adoc#,Translating>> requests and responses so that services receive them in the format that they are expecting.
* <<../filters/rate-limiting.adoc#,Rate limiting>> requests and responses to control network traffic.
* <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#,Authenticating>> requests to enhance security.
* <<../filters/api-validator.adoc#,Validating>> that requests conform to XSD and WADL specifications.
* <<../filters/slf4j-http-logging.adoc#,Logging>> to keep inventories of events.
* <<../filters/header-normalization.adoc#,Blacklisting>> to prevent others from spoofing authentication credentials and roles.
* <<../filters/keystone-v2.adoc#Cache,Caching>> to reduce load on authentication services.
* <<role-based-access-control.adoc#,Role-based access control (RBAC)>> to restrict access to authorized users.
* <<../filters/api-validator.adoc#,API Coverage>> to map the state of your API.
* <<../architecture/container.adoc#,HTTP Client Authentication>> for federated applications.
* <<../architecture/container.adoc#,SSL/TLS Termination>> and Ciphers/Protocols inclusion/exclusion.

== Who Can Use Repose?
Anyone can use *Repose*!
It is an open-source platform for the general public to consume, share, and improve.

== How Can I Use Repose?
To get *Repose*, log in to your server and run the <<Installation>> commands for your desired environment.
Then, configure your origin service endpoint in the <<../architecture/system-model.adoc#,system model>>, and you are ready to configure <<../filters/index.adoc#,filters>> and <<../services/index.adoc#,services>> that work for you.
We have many sample configurations that you can use to get started.
Or, because *Repose* is open source, you can <<custom-filter-for-repose.adoc#,build your own>> stacks of reusable software components.

=== Environment Setup
Installation instructions are provided for Debian package managers (e.g., APT) and RPM package managers (e.g., Yum).

Certain deployment methods will handle environment setup automatically.

=== Installation
The recommended and most common way to run *Repose* is as a standalone application using the Valve installation.
This installation allows *Repose* to be executed either as a Linux service (e.g., systemd) or directly from the installed JAR.

The most recent addition to the *Repose* family is a containerized release of the Valve installation.
This is great if you are looking to eventually run *Repose* with a container service or are just trying it out for the first time.

While *Repose* can be installed manually, there are other deployment options available.
However, these other methods do require a little more System Administration knowledge which is not covered here.
See: <<Deployment>>

==== Proxy Server (Valve)
This is the most common setup and is detailed on the <<valve-installation.adoc#,Valve Installation>> page.

After installing it this way, consult the <<running-valve.adoc#,Running Valve>> page for details on starting and stopping *Repose*.

==== Docker Container
See <<quick-start.adoc#,Quick Start>> for more details.

=== Deployment
Once you know how you'll want to configure *Repose*, you may want to automate the deployment using a configuration management tool or reusable container.

==== Docker
Docker and *Repose* make a fantastic team together.
If you are interested in using the published *Repose Docker* images, see our <<quick-start.adoc#,Quick Start>>.
For more details on building a custom *Repose Docker* image, see our <<docker.adoc#,Docker>> recipe.

==== Puppet
There is an unsupported starter module in the GitHub repository https://github.com/rackerlabs/puppet-repose[rackerlabs/puppet-repose].

==== Chef
There is an unsupported starter cookbook in the GitHub repository https://github.com/rackerlabs/cookbook-repose[rackerlabs/cookbook-repose].

=== Configuration
If you're ready to dive into configuration, see <<../architecture/configuration.adoc#,Configuration>> for more details.
We also have a series of <<index.adoc#,Recipes>> that will walk you through some of our common use cases.

=== Performance Tuning
*Repose* has been battle tested in production environments and in our performance testing environments.
See <<performance-best-practices.adoc#,Performance Best Practices>> for more details.
