= Servlet Specification

The https://javaee.github.io/servlet-spec/[Java Servlet Specification] is a document that details the design and API of a Java-based system that can respond to requests.
To learn more about the specification itself, visit the link near the start of this paragraph.

*Repose* is built on top of the servlet specification.
However, *Repose* also constrains the specification in certain ways.
For example, *Repose* can only service HTTP requests.

To understand the architecture of *Repose*, it is vital that one understands the servlet specification.
Currently, *Repose* complies with version 3.0 of the specification.

== Filter
The `ReposeFilter` class implements the `Filter` API and is the only filter in the base containers `FilterChain`.
It uses the `ReposeFilterLoader` class to load the `FilterContext` 's that are passed to the `ReposeFilterChain`.

Before calling into the Repose Filter Chain, it enhances the request from the client with a unique Transaction ID, if one is not already present, and starts a span with the <<../services/open-tracing.adoc#,OpenTracing Service>>.
When the Repose Filter Chain completes, the OpenTracing span is closed, the Via header is updated on the response, and the <<../services/metrics.adoc#,Metrics Service>> is updated.

== Filter Chain

The `ReposeFilterChain` class implements the `FilterChain` API, and is responsible for the coordination between filters.
That coordination includes things like dynamic determination of whether or not a filter should process a request or response, debug logging, and metrics gathering.
To learn more about this component, visit the <<filter-chain.adoc#,filter chain documentation page>>.

== Servlet

The `ReposeRoutingServlet` class implements the `Servlet` API and is registered with the servlet container.
It is responsible for routing the HTTP request from *Repose* to the origin service after the filter chain has finished processing the request.

This servlet uses the configuration information stored in the <<system-model.adoc#,System Model>> to determine what destinations are available.
Routing to an app on the same host but in another container or environment is easily configured in a generic way.

The preferred deployment strategy is to put a repose node as a side-car proxy on the same host as the origin service in a 1 to 1 fashion.
If *Repose* needs to horizontally scale at a different rate from the origin service, then putting an external load balancer as the destination is the safer option.
