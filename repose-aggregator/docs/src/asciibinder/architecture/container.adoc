= Container

The container configuration is required to set up *Repose*.
It is used to tell the system where to look for component artifacts and where to deploy them.

== Configuration
The following example shows a basic configuration for the Container file.

[source,xml]
.container.cfg.xml - Default
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<repose-container xmlns='http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/container/v2.0'>
    <deployment-config>
        <deployment-directory auto-clean="false">/var/repose</deployment-directory>
        <artifact-directory check-interval="60000">/usr/share/repose/filters</artifact-directory>
        <logging-configuration href="file:///etc/repose/log4j2.xml"/>
    </deployment-config>
</repose-container>
----

=== link:../schemas/container-configuration.xsd[Schema]

== Artifacts

Artifacts are files containing resources which extend the functionality of *Repose*.
Technically, *Repose* artifacts are Enterprise Application Archives (EARs).

For example, as part of the package installation of *Repose* (either using a DEB or RPM package), a `filter-bundle-x.x.x.x.ear` artifact is placed in the default artifact directory.
The filter bundle artifact provides a number of filters that can be used in the filter chain, as well as descriptors of those filters.
Without this artifact, *Repose* would not know about the filters contained within, and therefore, would be not able to use those filters in the filter chain.

== Deployment

The deployment process is the process by which *Repose* organizes the content of <<Artifacts>> in preparation for utilization.

To be more specific, the deployment process is comprised of the following steps:

. Identify all artifacts in the `artifact-directory`.
. Compute the hash of each artifact.
. Create a directory for each artifact as a subdirectory of the `deployment-directory`.
.. Each artifact will be associated with its own directory.
.. The name of each directory will be the hash of the associated artifact.
. Extract the contents of the each artifact to its associated directory.

Since each artifact is extracted to a directory named the hash of said artifact, deployment directory names are consistent and predictable.
As a result, there will be only one copy of the extracted contents of each artifact, and therefore, disk space usage should also be predictable.

If an artifact file exists on disk prior to the deployment process, the checksum of the artifact file will be compared to the checksum of the artifact to be deployed.
If the checksums match, deployment of the artifact in question will be skipped.
If the checksums do not match, the artifact will be deployed, overwriting the existing artifact file.
To prevent contention during the deployment process, a platform-dependent lock will be acquired on the artifact file.
The lock should prevent other processes from accessing the artifact file while it is being processed.
Ultimately, the checksum and locking strategy should ensure valid deployments while preventing unnecessary writes to disk and file contention when multiple *Repose* processes are running concurrently.

The `auto-clean` feature may be used to delete deployment directories when *Repose* shuts down.
This feature helps manage disk space usage, and remove the contents of artifacts which are no longer in use.
Only deployment directories created by the instance of *Repose* which is shutting down will be deleted.

[WARNING]
====
If all of the follow conditions are met, *Repose* may delete deployment directories that are in use by other *Repose* processes:

* More than one *Repose* process is running.
* More than one *Repose* process is using the same deployment directory.
* At least one *Repose* process has enabled the `auto-clean` feature.
* One of the *Repose* processes with the `auto-clean` feature enabled stops gracefully.

To avoid this situation, it is highly recommended that the `deployment-directory` is not shared between more than one *Repose* instance if the `auto-clean` feature is used.

If the `auto-clean` feature is not being used, it should be safe to share the `deployment-directory` between multiple *Repose* instances.
====

[WARNING]
====
Files in the deployment directory are only removed if the `auto-clean` feature is used, and even then, only when *Repose* shuts down.
Since files in the deployment directory are made accessible to *Repose* at runtime (via the classpath), files in the deployment directory that are not managed by *Repose* could affect the behavior of *Repose* and could even result in errors.
As such, care should be taken to ensure that errant files do not end up in the deployment directory.
====

[NOTE]
====
Something else to be aware of is that the `deployment-directory` and `artifact-directory` values should be fully qualified paths.
This is the case as the exact location of the launcing JVM may not remain in the same location and this would effect relative paths.
The path should not start or end with a whitespace character as all leading and trailing whitespace is ignored in reading this value.
All white space in the middle of the path name will be preserved and should not be escaped in any way.
====

== Via Header Configuration

The following assume:

* the request and response are `HTTP/1.1`
* the host is `localhost`
* the servicing port is `10010`
* the *Repose* version is `8.4.1.0`

The interaction between the deprecated `via` attribute and the new `via-header` element are as follows:

[cols="4", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|via attribute | via-header element | Request header                         | Response header
|Undefined     | Undefined          | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | `1.1 Repose (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|`Stuff`       | Undefined          | `1.1 Stuff (Repose/8.4.1.0)`           | `1.1 Stuff (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|`Stuff`       | **Defined**        2+| Will not parse
|===

The following further assumes the deprecated `via` attribute is not defined and the `via-header` element contains:

[cols="5", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|request-prefix | response-prefix | repose-version | Request header                         | Response header
|Undefined      | Undefined       | Undefined      | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | `1.1 Repose (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|`Potato`       | Undefined       | Undefined      | `1.1 Potato (Repose/8.4.1.0)`          | `1.1 Repose (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|Undefined      | `Salad`         | Undefined      | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | `1.1 Salad (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|`Potato`       | `Salad`         | Undefined      | `1.1 Potato (Repose/8.4.1.0)`          | `1.1 Salad (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|Undefined      | Undefined       | `true`         | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | `1.1 Repose (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|`Potato`       | Undefined       | `true`         | `1.1 Potato (Repose/8.4.1.0)`          | `1.1 Repose (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|Undefined      | `Salad`         | `true`         | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | `1.1 Salad (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|`Potato`       | `Salad`         | `true`         | `1.1 Potato (Repose/8.4.1.0)`          | `1.1 Salad (Repose/8.4.1.0)`
|Undefined      | Undefined       | `false`        | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | No header *added*
|`Potato`       | Undefined       | `false`        | `1.1 Potato (Repose/8.4.1.0)`          | No header *added*
|Undefined      | `Salad`         | `false`        | `1.1 localhost:10010 (Repose/8.4.1.0)` | `1.1 Salad`

|===

== User-Supplied Logging Configuration
There are two steps to supply a logging configuration for *Repose*:

. Add a log configuration file to the *Repose* configuration files directory (e.g., `/etc/repose`).
. Specify the name of the log configuration file in the `container.cfg.xml` file.
  It should look like the following example.

[source,xml]
.container.cfg.xml - Logging
----
<logging-configuration href="file:///etc/repose/log4j2.xml"/>
----

== Default Logging Configuration
If a user-supplied logging configuration file is not found, *Repose* programmatically sets default log4j properties.
This default properties add a
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html#ConsoleAppender[ConsoleAppender]
to the ROOT logger.
The output will be formatted using a
https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternLayout[PatternLayout]
set to the pattern `%d %-4r [%t] %-5p %c - %m%n`.
The default log level is set to DEBUG.

== SSL/TLS Client Authentication
SSL/TLS Client Authentication is being used more and more for communications between different enclaves.
This addition to the SSL/TLS handshake involves the Client presenting credentials to the Server in the same manner as the Server does to the Client.
If the credentials presented by the Client are not trusted, then the Server will sever the connection just as the Client would have if the situation was reversed.
Since a Client initiates contact with the Server, the Server's credentials are simply to validate it is who the Client was trying to contact.
This is accomplished through Certificate Authorities (CA) and the Trust Hierarchies built into the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
Even though you can optionally add a particular Server's credentials directly into a Client so that it will implicitly trust a particular Server essentially bypassing the distributed trust mechanism in favor of a more direct one, this is the only way to build a relationship for a Client to a Server.

To require SSL/TLS Client Authentication, set the `need-client-auth` attribute to _True_.
With this setting enabled, only Clients that have a Public Key imported into the trust store referenced by the `truststore-filename` element will be allowed to connect.
The truststore is a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#KeystoreImplementation[Java Keystore]
that can be created/updated using the command line tool named aptly enough,
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html[keytool].
Below is an example of importing a Client certificate (`client.crt`) into a truststore (`truststore.jks`):

[source,bash]
.keytool
----
keytool -import -file client.crt -alias client -keystore truststore.jks
----

[NOTE]
====
This will update the keystore if it exists or create a new one if it doesn't.
The tool will also prompt for a password.
The password will be used to access an existing file or set as the password on a new one.
====

To use the truststore created/updated in the example above, the following would need to be added/updated in the container.cfg.xml file:

[source,xml]
.container.cfg.xml - Truststore
----
<ssl-configuration need-client-auth="true">
    <truststore-filename>truststore.jks</truststore-filename>
    <truststore-password>password</truststore-password>
----

== Valve Configuration of SSL/TLS Certificates
*Repose Valve* is based on Jetty and uses its services for SSL/TLS termination.
To enable this feature you need to:

. Obtain keys and certificates from somewhere OR http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html[generate them].
. http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html#loading-keys-and-certificates[Load the keys and certificates into a keystore file].
. Place the keystore file in your *Repose* configuration root directory.
. Place the keystore information in your `container.cfg.xml` file.
. Place the desired HTTPS port in your `system-model.cfg.xml` file.
  See <<system-model.adoc#,System Model>> for more details.

Keystore information is located within the `<ssl-configuration>` element as shown in the following example.

[source,xml]
.container.cfg.xml - SSL/TLS Certificates
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<repose-container xmlns='http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/container/v2.0'>
    <deployment-config>
        <deployment-directory auto-clean="false">/var/repose</deployment-directory>
        <artifact-directory check-interval="60000">/usr/share/repose/filters</artifact-directory>
        <logging-configuration href="log4j2.xml"/>
        <ssl-configuration>
            <keystore-filename>keystore.repose</keystore-filename>
            <keystore-password>manage</keystore-password>
            <key-password>password</key-password>
        </ssl-configuration>
    </deployment-config>
</repose-container>

== Whitelisting and Blacklisting Ciphers and Protocols
[WARNING]
====
Since security is a constantly moving target, any recommended configuration would quickly become out of date.
A risk assessment should always be performed by the appropriately qualified people for your organization.
Links to industry-standard references are provided in the SSL References section below.
====

*Repose* supports whitelisting and blacklisting specific protocols and ciphers by exposing portions of the Jetty configuration via the `container.cfg.xml` file.
You can use this feature if a specific protocol or cipher has been compromised and you want to block its usage and harden your *Repose* instance.
All of Jetty's built-in default allowed protocols and ciphers are cleared and then the configured inclusion and exclusion lists are applied if an `ssl-configuration` is specified.

[quote, Jetty, The Definitive Reference]
____
When working with Includes / Excludes, it is important to know that Excludes will always win.
____

Protocols and ciphers are configured using the same process.
We start with the list of all that are available on the host system.
This list is culled to contain only those that match the `included` RegEx statements.
Then the list is further culled to remove any that match the `excluded` RegEx statements.

In the following example, the container configuration includes only the recommended TLS ciphers and protocols.
This in turn automatically excludes all SSL protocols and ciphers as they do not meet the inclusion criteria.

[source,xml]
.container.cfg.xml - Protocols and ciphers
----
<repose-container xmlns='http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/container/v2.0'>
    <deployment-config>
        <deployment-directory auto-clean="false">/var/repose</deployment-directory>
        <artifact-directory check-interval="60000">/usr/share/repose/filters</artifact-directory>
        <logging-configuration href="file:///etc/repose/log4j2.xml"/>
        <ssl-configuration>
            <keystore-filename>keystore.jks</keystore-filename>
            <keystore-password>password</keystore-password>
            <key-password>password</key-password>
            <!-- include only the recommended protocols and ciphers -->
            <included-protocols>
                <protocol>TLSv1.2</protocol>
            </included-protocols>
            <included-ciphers>
                <!-- This allows only the following:
                - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
                - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
                - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
                - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
                - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384
                - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
                -->
                <cipher>TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_(128|256)_(CBC|GCM)_SHA(256|384)?</cipher>
                <!-- The opening ^ and closing $ are assumed and will cause failure if present. -->
            </included-ciphers>
            <tls-renegotiation-allowed>false</tls-renegotiation-allowed>
        </ssl-configuration>
    </deployment-config>
</repose-container>
----

[NOTE]
====
You need to specify your keystore in the container configuration just as you would in Jetty.
====

== Diffie-Hellman Security Risk and Key Size
Certain attacks (such as Logjam) leverage the weakness of "small" Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys.
To mitigate the risk of such attackers, users may either exclude vulnerable ciphers, or lengthen the DH keys used by *Repose*.
Instructions for the former are above.
For the latter, note the following:

[quote, Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) Reference Guide]
____
Diffie-Hellman (DH) keys of sizes less than 1024 bits have been deprecated because of their insufficient strength.
In JDK 8, you can customize the ephemeral DH key size with the system property jdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize.
____

In other words, the Java option `-Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048` can be passed when starting *Repose* to force the use of longer DH keys.

For more details, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html#customizing_dh_keys[Customizing DH Keys].

== SSL/TLS References
For more information about cipher suites and which ones to dis/allow when setting up *Repose*, see the following references:

* http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/76993/now-that-it-is-2015-what-ssl-tls-cipher-suites-should-be-used-in-a-high-securit
* https://www.ssllabs.com/
* https://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/CipherSuites#Enabling_Cipher_Suites
* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet
* https://cipherli.st/

== Available Ciphers and Protocols
The list of available ciphers and protocols varies depending on the JVM.
We have added a command line option to *Repose Valve* to display the available and default enabled ciphers and protocols:

[source,bash]
.Show SSL Params
----
java -jar /usr/share/repose/repose.jar --show-ssl-params
----

This will dump a list of the default enabled SSL/TLS parameters for the JVM you're using.
Additionally, it will list all available ciphers and protocols, should you wish to use one of those.

== Running in Insecure Mode
[WARNING]
====
This mode should only be used during development testing.
These settings are NOT intended for a production environment.
====

When running in insecure mode, *Repose* will accept all certificates from external services with which it communicates (e.g., authentication service, origin service).

[source,bash]
.Insecure Mode
----
java -jar /usr/share/repose/repose.jar -c /etc/repose -k
----
