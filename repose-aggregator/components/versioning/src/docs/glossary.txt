* CONFIGURATION DATA

** serviceRootHref = The base href for the target service.
    e.g. if the full url is "http://rackspacecloud.com/v1.1/the/target/resource/" the service root href would be: "http://rackspacecloud.com/"

** configuredHosts = The map of hosts pulled from a configuration file.  The hosts will have a unique id (also known as the "power proxy host id", or ppHostId.  The host's href should contain the service root href and possibly the target version number.  The configuredHosts map will use the ppHostId as the key.

** serviceMappings = The map of supported services.  Each service has a unique id that consists of the version number only.  Each mapping has a human-readable name and a ppHostId that maps back to one of the configuredHosts.  Each map entry uses the version number as the map key.
