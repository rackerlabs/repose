The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) filter allows Repose to manage CORS requests without the origin service needing to understand CORS.
For an introduction to CORS, see the <<CORS Overview>> below.

WARNING: Before enabling the CORS filter, you should be familiar with the CORS specification and the associated security implications.
Enabling CORS can increase an endpoint's exposure.
Configuring CORS improperly could expose CSRF vulnerabilities in the origin service that were previously blocked by not supporting CORS.

== Headers

=== Required
The presence of certain headers will indicate what kind of request is being made.
All of these headers will be supplied by the client making the request.

[cols="3", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Non-CORS Request
| Preflight CORS Request
| Actual CORS Request

| None required
a| * `Origin`
   * `Access-Control-Request-Method`
a| * `Origin`
|===

=== Created
The CORS filter wil not add any headers to the response for non-CORS requests.
The filter will add the following headers to the response for these scenarios when the request is allowed to proceed:

[cols="2", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Preflight CORS Request
| Actual CORS Request

a| * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
a| * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
   * `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`

|===

If the CORS filter rejects the request, the following header will be added to the response:

* `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

== Early Termination Conditions
These are the scenarios in which the CORS filters will stop processing the request and immediately return a response:

[cols="3", options="header"]
|===
|Response Code
|Request Type
|Reason

|200
|Preflight Request
|Origin is allowed

|403
|Preflight Request
|Origin not allowed

|403
|Preflight Request
|Method not allowed

|403
|Actual Request
|Origin not allowed

|403
|Actual Request
|Method not allowed
|===

== Filter Chain
*Filter name:* `cors`

=== Ordering
It should be one of the first filters, if not the first filter, in the filter chain in order to properly handle Preflight CORS requests.
If you want to rate limit Preflight CORS requests, you can add these filters before the CORS filter in the filter chain:

. <<ip-user.adoc#,IP User Filter>>
. <<rate-limiting.adoc#,Rate Limiting Filter>>

This Rate Limiting filter would be in addition to any Rate Limiting filter you may already have in place.
The first Rate Limiting filter would filter only by IP address,
and the second Rate Limiting filter would continue to rate limit the way it is currently set up.
Preflight requests do not contain credentials which is why the CORS filter needs to be one of the first filters.

== Configuration
*Default Configuration Filename:* `cors.cfg.xml`

=== Basic Example
A basic CORS configuration would allow all origins to use any standard HTTP method on all resources.
This could expose vulnerabilities and is not recommended outside of a development environment.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cross-origin-resource-sharing
    xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/cross-origin-resource-sharing/v1.0">

    </allowed-methods>
</cross-origin-resource-sharing>
----
<1> Allow all origins.
<2> Allow these HTTP methods on all resources.

=== Limit Origins
To limit which origins are allowed to initiate a CORS request to your API,
you can specify the exact header value or specify a regex value.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cross-origin-resource-sharing
    xmlns="http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/cross-origin-resource-sharing/v1.0">

    <allowed-origins>
        <origin>https://subdomain.other-domain.com:8443</origin> <!--1-->
        <origin regex="true">http://.*.subdomain.rackspace.com:.*</origin> <!--2-->
    </allowed-origins>

    <allowed-methods> <!--3-->
        <method>GET</method>
        <method>POST</method>
    </allowed-methods>
</cross-origin-resource-sharing>
----
<1> Allow this specific origin.
<2> Allow any subdomain of ".subdomain.rackspace.com" on any port.
<3> Allow HTTP methods GET and POST on all resources.

=== Limit Methods By Resource
If specific resources support additional HTTP methods,
you can configure this per-resource using a regex to specify the path or paths.
The resource configuration is processed in the configured order,
so the first path regex to match the request URI will be used in conjunction with the global allowed-methods configuration.
This will be used to determine the complete list of allowed methods to return in response to a CORS Preflight request,
and it will be used to validate whether or not a CORS request is allowed to proceed.

WARNING: This is not a substitution for authorization.
Requests that do not contain the `Origin` header are not CORS requests and completely bypass this verification.

</cross-origin-resource-sharing>
----
<1> Allow HTTP methods GET and HEAD on all resources.
<2> The /v1/status endpoint doesn't support anything other than GET and HEAD.
<3> The rest of /v1 supports POST and PUT in addition to GET and HEAD.
<4> All other non /v1 endpoints support POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE in addition to GET and HEAD.

Using this configuration,
you would see the following:

[cols="3", options="header"]

|/v1/servers
|/v1/.*
|GET, HEAD, POST, PUT

|/v2/servers
|/.*
|GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

|/index.html
|/.*
|GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

----
<1> At least one `origin` element is required.
<2> The `regex` attribute is not required.
If it is not present,
it is defaulted to `false` and the specified URI is treated as a literal string.
<3> When the `regex` attribute is `true`,
the specified URI will be treated as a Java regular expression.
<4> At least one `method` element is required.
<5> The `resources` element is optional.
<6> At least one `resource` element is required when the `resources` element is present.
<7> The `path` attribute is required and is always treated as a Java regular expression.
<8> The `allowed-methods` element is optional.
Leaving it out is useful when you need to prevent adding additional HTTP methods to a sub-resource as is the case with `/v1/status.*` in this example.
<9> At least one `method` element is required when the `allowed-methods` element is present.

=== Schema

== CORS Overview
For security purposes, web browsers follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy[Single-Origin policy].
If a user were to visit a website containing malicious code,
the web browser would prevent the malicious code from trying to send requests to different websites on the user's behalf.
This is especially useful when the user is authenticated on those other websites.
However, sometimes we need to be able to get data and perform actions on different websites than the originating one.
This is where CORS comes in.

Instead of the web browser immediately denying any request intended for a different server,
it can send the request with additional CORS headers.
One of these headers is the `Origin` header which indicates which website is responsible for sending the web browser to a different server.
If the response from the second server does not contain the appropriate CORS headers (i.e. the server is not CORS-aware)
or if the CORS headers indicate the Origin is not allowed to send requests to it,
the browser will drop the response (i.e. the client-side code will never get to see the contents of the response).

Even though the web browser prevents the client code from seeing the response,
the request would still have been sent and potentially processed by the second server.
To mitigate potential server-side issues,
the web browser will send a Preflight Request to first verify that the Origin and HTTP method are allowed (among a few other things) before sending the Actual Request.
If the response to the Preflight Request indicates the Actual Request wouldn't include the appropriate CORS headers that would allow the client code to process the response,
the web browser will not proceed with sending the Actual Request.

A request is considered a *Preflight Request* if it meets the following:

* HTTP method is OPTIONS
* Header exists for `Origin`
* Header exists for `Access-Control-Request-Method`

NOTE: Preflight Requests are completely handled by the CORS filter.
No other filters after the CORS filter will process them,
and they won't reach the origin service.

A request will be considered an *Actual Request* if it meets the following:

* Header exists for `Origin`
* Header _does not_ exist for `Access-Control-Request-Method`

NOTE: Some web browsers (e.g. Chrome and Safari) will send the `Origin` header for same-origin requests.
Because of this, the configured list of allowed origins should include your own origin.
If per-resource validation is being used,
it would need to include all of the resources that non-CORS requests are expected to service,
or the CORS filter would need to be skipped for those resources in the System Model configuration using a regular expression.

Preflight Requests _may_ be skipped for the following types of requests:

* HTTP method is GET, HEAD, or POST
* Headers do not include anything other than `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`, and `Content-Type`
(assuming the values are `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, or `text/plain`).

NOTE: If your origin service requires a special header (e.g. `X-Auth-Token`),
a Preflight Request will always be sent for CORS requests.

WARNING: CORS is not a security feature.
It is a mechanism for informing clients (e.g. web browsers) of conditions when client-side security can be slightly relaxed in certain circumstances.
That is, the security lies completely within the client.
Simply leaving out the `Origin` header in the request completely bypasses the CORS spec (and thus this filter).
You should continue securing your API in other ways using proper authentication and authorization.
