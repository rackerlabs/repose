= Rackspace Auth User Filter

include::../_includes/in-progress.adoc[]

The Rackspace Auth User filter is for usage in *Repose* instances that sit in front of Keystone v1 and v2 deployments.
It's meant to be used for login requests to capture username for both <<../recipes/rate-limiting.adoc#,rate limiting>> and <<../recipes/user-access-events.adoc#,user access events>>.

== Headers

=== Required
This filter doesn't look for any headers to be present in either the request or response.

=== Created
[cols="3", options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Request Headers | Value                   | Conditions of Creation

| `X-PP-User`     | Username in the request | Username present in the request. Prepended with `Racker:` if domain was present and had a value of `Rackspace`.

| `X-User-Name`   | Username in the request | Username present in the request. Prepended with `Racker:` if domain was present and had a value of `Rackspace`.

| `X-PP-Groups`   | Configured value        | Username present in the request.

| `X-Domain`      | Domain in the request   | Username and Domain present in the request.
|===

== Early Termination Conditions
There are no cases where this filter will terminate further processing of the filter chain.

== Filter Chain
*Filter Name:* `rackspace-auth-user`

=== Ordering
This filter needs to appear in the filter chain before any of the filters that need the information that is derived here.
That means the <<rate-limiting.adoc#,rate limiting filter>> when rate limiting, and <<herp.adoc#,herp filter>> when doing user access events.
When doing both the order should be:

. Rackspace Auth User
. Highly Efficeint Record Processor
. Rate Limiting

For further details about the reasoning behind this ordering see <<../recipes/user-access-events.adoc#,user access events>>.

== Configuration
*Default Configuration Filename:* `rackspace-auth-user.cfg.xml`

=== Full Example
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rackspace-auth-user
    xmlns='http://docs.openrepose.org/repose/rackspace-auth-user/v1.0'>

    <v1_1 content-body-read-limit="2048"> <!--1--> <!--2-->
        <group>1_1 Group</group> <!--3-->
        <quality>0.75</quality> <!--4-->
    </v1_1>

    <v2_0> <!--5-->
        <group>2_0 Group</group> <!--3-->
        <quality>0.80</quality> <!--4-->
    </v2_0>

</rackspace-auth-user>
----
<1> The `v1_1` element lets the filter know that you'd like to try to process bodies using the 1.1 contract.
    It is optional.
<2> The `content-body-read-limit` attribute specifies how much of the body you'd like the filter to read before giving up and assuming it's not present.
    It is optional and defaults to `4096`.
<3> The `group` element specifies what group name to use in the `X-PP-Groups` header.
    It is optional and defaults to `Pre_Auth`.
<4> The `quality` element specifies what quality to apply to the `X-PP-User` and `X-PP-Groups` headers, it should be a value between `0` and `1.0`.
    It is optional and defaults to `0.6`.
<5> The `v2_0` element is similar to the `v1_1` element but specifies that the filter should try to process request bodies with the 2.0 contract.
    It is optional.
    The elements are not exclusive and you can specify one, both, or neither.
    This element can also take a `content-body-read-limit` attribute with the same behavior as the `v1_1` element.
