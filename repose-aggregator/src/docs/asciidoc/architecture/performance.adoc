= Performance Testing

include::../_includes/in-progress.adoc[]

Performance testing is a method of testing various aspects of Repose in order to collect performance data.
Performance data can be used to determine the overhead of the aspects in question, both at a system resource level as well as at a response time level.

To performance test Repose, and collect the resulting data for analysis, the <<Framework>> is used.

== Methodology

In an attempt to provide the most meaningful data possible, the following test cases will be covered by independent tests:

* The simplest (i.e., passthrough) Repose deployment.
* Every Repose filter.
* A relatively complex Repose deployment.
* Common Repose deployments (e.g., RBAC).

== Framework

=== Design

The overall design of the automatic performance testing framework can be outlined succinctly by the following diagram:

\--------/             \-------/
....

A code change in the Repose GitHub repository on the master branch will trigger a Jenkins job to run.
The Jenkins job will run the Ansible playbooks for all defined test cases.
The Ansible playbooks, in turn, will provision the necessary cloud resources and begin executing the Gatling simulations for each test case.
As Gatling runs, it will pipe the performance data it captures to InfluxDB.
Once Gatling execution completes, the cloud resources will be cleaned up, and the Ansible playbook will finish executing.
Grafana will query InfluxDB to retrieve the performance data which is available in the http://grafana.openrepose.org/dashboard/db/performance-tests?orgId=1[Performance Tests dashboard].

==== Gatling

Data will be transported from Gatling to InfluxDB using the Graphite line protocol.
The data being transferred will include numerous statistics calculated for a distinct time.
To get a better idea of the data in question, a sample has been provided which captures the number of request/response pairs sent at time `1492629621` as well as various statistics calculated from the amount of time taken to service those requests.
Note that the sample data only captures a single second of the Gatling simulation.
Much more data of the same form would be expected for every second that the Gatling simulation ran.

....

==== InfluxDB

InfluxDB will process the data it receives through its Graphite listener port by applying configured templates.
These templates will translate the metric names from the Graphite line protocol into measurements, fields, tags, and values in the database.

For example, given the sample data provided in the <<Gatling, Gatling section>>, the following template could be applied:

....
gatling.*.*.*.* measurement.simulation.request.status.field
....

Resulting in a database full of entries like the following:

.Measurement Name: gatling
[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Field/Tag Key | Field/Tag Value
|time          | 1492629621000000000

==== Deployment

The following diagram illustrates the interactions between each component referenced in the <<Design>>.

image::../images/performance-test-framework.png[Performance Test Framework]

=== Creating a New Test

[NOTE]
====
In the directory structure of the performance tests, all test-specific files are organized by test and category.
That is, each file is located in a directory named after the specific test which is itself located in a directory named after the category of test.
For example, the `repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests/roles/repose/files/config/` directory contains the `filters/` and `use-cases/` sub-directories and the common file `log4j2.xml`.
====

. Create a vars file for the new test.
.. These are located in `repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests/test_vars/`.
.. At a minimum, it should contain the `dir_prefix`, the filter chain, and the Gatling simulation name and package.
.. The Gatling simulation name should follow the pattern: Name Type "Simulation" (e.g., SamlFilterSimulation, ComplexUseCaseSimulation).
. If necessary, add Repose configuration files.
.. Create any necessary new directories under `repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests/roles/repose/` with the same names and hierarchy configured in the `dir_prefix`.
Template files should be placed under the `templates/config/` directory, and raw configuration files should be placed under the `files/config/` directory.
. Create a http://gatling.io/docs/current/general/concepts/#simulation[Gatling simulation].
.. Create a new directory under `repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests/roles/gatling/files/simulations/` with the same name as the configured Gatling simulation package (may be different than `dir_prefix`).
.. Write a Gatling simulation with the same name as the configured Gatling simulation name.
This code will be responsible for generating test traffic and performance test data.
. If necessary, add mock services.
.. Create any necessary new directories under `repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests/roles/repose/files/mocks/`.

[NOTE]
====
Ansible supports Jinja2 templates.
These templates allow users to add dynamic content to files and Ansible variables.
Jinja2 templated files should always be placed in the `templates/` sub-directory of a role directory and have a `.j2` file extension.
====

=== Running a Test Automatically

A Jenkins job is triggered any time that code on the master branch of the https://github.com/rackerlabs/repose[Repose Git Repository] changes.
The Jenkins job will run the performance tests and publish the results automatically.
<<Design>> describes the full automated process in more detail.

=== Running a Test Manually

If you have the appropriate permissions on the Repose Jenkins instance, you can run the https://jenkins.openrepose.org/job/performance-test/[performance-test] Jenkins job to manually start a single performance test.

. In the https://jenkins.openrepose.org/job/performance-test/[performance-test] Jenkins job click on the https://jenkins.openrepose.org/job/performance-test/build?delay=0sec[Build with Parameters] link.
. Populate the build parameters for the test you want to run.
. Click Build.

.performance-test build parameters

|===

=== Running a Test Locally

. Set up your environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
We use Puppet to manage our performance test environment.
The details of our environment can be found in our https://github.com/rackerlabs/repose-infrastructure-ng/blob/master/myModules/repose_jenkins/manifests/performance_slave.pp[Puppet manifest].
If you have https://puppet.com/[Puppet] installed, you can download our manifest and re-create our environment by running `puppet apply` directly on the downloaded file.
====
. Clone the https://github.com/rackerlabs/repose[Repose GitHub repository] from Github. +
`git clone https://github.com/rackerlabs/repose.git`
. Navigate to the performance test directory in the project. +
`cd repose/repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests`
. Run the `start_test.yml` Ansible playbook. +
This playbook will create the necessary Cloud resources, provision the servers, and execute the Gatling simulation.
When running the playbook, you may specify which test to run and what configuration to override for that test.
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \ # <1>
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml, # <2>
       gatling: {test: {params: {duration_in_min: 15, saml: {num_of_issuers: 2}}}}}' \ # <3>
  -vvvv # <4>
----
<1> Run the `start_test.yml` playbook.
<2> Set the config value for `perf_test` to `filters/saml` to run the SAML test.
<3> Override the values for the two config parameters using YAML syntax.
<4> Provide very verbose output.
. View the <<Results>>.
. Clean up cloud resources. +
`ansible-playbook stop_test.yml -e '{perf_test: filters/saml}' -vvvv`


== Results

=== Grafana Dashboard

[IMPORTANT]
.TODO
====
* Describe the dashboard.
====

Grafana serves as the user interface to performance test data which can be seen in the http://grafana.openrepose.org/dashboard/db/performance-tests?orgId=1[Performance Tests dashboard].


=== HTML Report

After test execution has completed, Gatling will generate an HTML report.
The report can be found inside an archive residing in the home directory with a file name like `SamlFilterSimulationRepose-1496319945650.tar.gz`.
The exact file name will be included in the output of the `Fetch the Gatling results` task which will resemble the following snippet:
[listing]
----
changed: [perf-filters-saml-testsuite01] => {
    "changed": true,
    "checksum": "9bf6327e21d9029870e81451287aef61428329bf",
    "dest": "/home/perftester/SamlFilterSimulationRepose-1496319945650.tar.gz", # <1>
    "md5sum": "aeace1aecfb4949b0e6bbd104e87b7a0",
    "remote_checksum": "9bf6327e21d9029870e81451287aef61428329bf",
    "remote_md5sum": null
}
----
<1> This is the file name.

After the report archive is located, the contents must be extracted before the report can be viewed.
That can be done with a command like the following: +
`tar xvf /home/perftester/SamlFilterSimulationRepose-1496319945650.tar.gz`

Once the report has been extracted, it can be viewed by opening the `index.html` file with a web browser.

== Debugging

=== Running Gatling Manually

If you need to manually run Gatling, you can do so from the Gatling host.

[source,bash]
----
export JAVA_OPTS="-Dtest.base_url=162.200.100.100:7070" # <1>
export GATLING_HOME="/root/gatling/current" # <2>
cd $GATLING_HOME

gatling -s filters.saml.SamlFilterSimulation # <3>
----
<1> The target host and port need to be specified for all of the simulations.
These JAVA_OPTS are only for Gatling and do not apply to Repose.
<2> `GATLING_HOME` needs to be set for Gatling to run.
<3> `filters.saml.SamlFilterSimulation` is the package-qualified class name of the simulation to run.
It should be replaced with the FQCN of the simulation that should be run.

=== Configuring Gatling Manually

Files and directories of interest:

* `conf/logback.xml` - Lets you turn on debug logging; useful to see the request and response data.
* `conf/application.conf` - The configuration file read by the simulations.
* `results/` - Contains all of the results.
* `user-files/simulations/` - Contains the test simulations written in Scala and organized by package.

== Additional Information

=== Warmup Duration

Run the simple use-case test for 15 minutes with a 5 minute warmup (20 minutes total):

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: use-cases/simple,
       gatling: {test: {params: {duration_in_min: 15, warmup_duration_in_min: 5}}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Skipping Repose or Origin Service Tests

By default, both the Repose test and the origin service test (i.e., Repose is bypassed) are run.
You can use Ansible tags to specify that only one of those tests should be run.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml}' \
  --tags "repose" \
  -vvvv
----

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml}' \
  --tags "origin" \
  -vvvv
----

=== Cloud Server Flavor

You can specify which cloud server flavor to use in the configuration overrides.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       cloud: {server: {repose: {flavor: performance1-4}}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Increasing Timeout for Repose Startup

By default, the Repose start task will wait 5 minutes for Repose to start up.
If you expect Repose to take longer to start (e.g., due to a large WADL), you can increase this timeout using a command like the following:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       repose: {service: {start_timeout_in_sec: 900}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Saxon

To get Repose to use Saxon, add a `saxon-license.lic` file to the `repose-aggregator/tests/performance-tests/roles/repose/files/` directory and pass in the following configuration override:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       repose: {systemd_opts: {use_saxon: true}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== JVM Options (Heap size, Garbage Collection, etc.)

You can set the JVM Options (`JAVA_OPTS`) used by Repose by setting the following configuration override:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       repose: {
         systemd_opts: {
           java_opts: "-Xmx2g -Xms2g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication"}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Automatic Cloud Resource Cleanup

Use the master playbook to run a performance test and immediately clean up afterwards without having to running the individual playbooks.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook site.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Running a Test Again

You can re-run a test using the same cloud resources by simply running the `start_test.yml` playbook again.
You can even specify different configuration overrides in subsequent runs, although there are some limitations.
For example, you can enable Saxon for a subsequent run, but you can't disable it afterwards.
Also, if you don't want the Repose JVM already warmed up from the previous run, you should have Ansible restart the Repose service.
This feature is considered experimental.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       repose: {service: {state: restarted}, systemd_opts: {use_saxon: true}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Gatling Output Directory Name

You can specify the base name of the directory containing the Gatling results in the configuration overrides.
For example, if you wanted the base name `custom-base-name` (resulting in a directory name resembling `custom-base-name-repose-1487812914968`), you would run:

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       gatling: {results: {output_dir: custom-base-name}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Running Parallel Tests

Running a performance test with a unique naming prefix enables you to run a particular test multiple times simultaneously (each run requires a unique prefix):

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       cloud: {naming_prefix: perf-saml-many-issuers},
       gatling: {test: {params: {saml: {num_of_issuers: 100}}}}}' \
  -vvvv
----

If you're using the `stop_test.yml` playbook to clean up your cloud resources, you'll need to include the unique prefix to ensure the correct resources are deleted.
If the prefix is not specified, the wrong cloud resources or no cloud resources could end up being deleted, and in both cases, no error will be returned (due to idempotency).

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook stop_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/saml,
       cloud: {naming_prefix: perf-saml-many-issuers}}' \
  -vvvv
----

=== Scripting Filter Test

When running a Scripting filter test, the `perf_test` variable will look slightly different than it does for other tests.
The reason is that the scripting language to be used in the test is nested one level down in the `perf_test` variable value.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook start_test.yml \
  -e '{perf_test: filters/scripting/python}' \
  -vvvv
----
