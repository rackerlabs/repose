= Functional Test Framework

The *Repose* functional test framework is a testing library provided by the *Repose* team meant to simplify the process of creating functional tests for features in *Repose* or its extension components.

This framework is based on the http://spockframework.org/[Spock framework].
While there are features of this framework that are can be used without Spock, it is expected that tests utilizing this framework will be Spock tests.

== Download

The *Repose* functional test framework is published to https://maven.research.rackspacecloud.com/[an instance of Nexus hosted by Rackspace].

It is highly recommended that a build system be used to manage this library.
The following snippets provide the necessary additions to download this framework with some popular build systems.

=== Maven

== Setup

There are two requirements that must be satisfied for this framework.

The first requirement is that a `repose-test.properties` file is on the classpath when tests are run.
The `repose-test.properties` file tells that framework what version of *Repose*, directories, host, and ports to use.
It should be in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties#Format[Java properties file format] like the following example:

[NOTE]
====
Not all properties are strictly required.
In fact, most properties have reasonable defaults.
However, any property which takes an absolute path should be given a value.

----
# Required Properties
test.root.directory=/default/test/root # <1>

repose.home=/default/repose/home # <2>
repose.config.templates=/default/config/templates # <3>

# Required (If Used) Properties
repose.jar=/default/valve/location # <4>
repose.lint.jar=/default/lint/location # <5>
repose.root.war=/default/root/war/location # <6>
glassfish.jar=/default/glassfish/location # <7>

# Optional Properties

repose.container=valve # <11>
repose.config.directory=/configs # <12>
repose.log.name=/logs/repose.log # <13>
repose.lint.log.name=/logs/repose-lint.log # <14>
repose.log.pattern=/logs/repose_%d{yyyy-MM-dd}-%i.log # <15>

target.hostname=localhost # <16>

port.finder.port.start=10000 # <17>
port.finder.port.max=65535 # <18>
port.finder.port.range=100 # <19>
port.finder.property.name.worker.id=org.gradle.test.worker # <20>
----
<1> The absolute path of the root directory to run tests under.
The user running the tests must have permission to read and write in this directory. +
It is advised that this be the build directory of the build tool being used to run the tests (e.g., `buildDir` in Gradle).
Doing so enables the build tool to handle cleanup of any test resources.
<2> The absolute path of the home directory which will contain *Repose* artifacts, and possibly other *Repose* test structures.
<3> The absolute path of the directory which contains the configuration file templates.
<4> The absolute path to the *Repose* JAR file.
<5> The absolute path of the *Repose Lint* JAR file.
<6> The absolute path of the *Repose* `ROOT.WAR` file.
<7> The absolute path of the Glassfish JAR file.
<8> The absolute path of the Tomcat JAR file.
<9> The absolute path of the WAR file containing mock services.
<10> The version of *Repose*.
<11> The servlet container to run *Repose* in.
A value of `valve` will run a standalone instance of *Repose* using an embedded container.
<12> The path of the directory relative to the `test.root.directory` or `repose.home` directory which will contain *Repose* configuration files.
<13> The *Repose* log file path relative to the `test.root.directory` or `repose.home` directory.
<14> The *Repose Lint* log file path relative to the `test.root.directory` or `repose.home`.
<15> The log filename path pattern relative to the `test.root.directory` or `repose.home` directory.
<16> The target hostname (usually `localhost`).
<17> The port number to start at when scanning for open ports.
<18> The max port number which can be used when scanning for open ports.
<19> The step size between workers when scanning for open ports.
<20> The name of a System property the value of which will be used as the worker ID.

The second requirement is that the *Repose* artifacts (e.g., JARs and EARs) must be placed in the directory specified by the `repose.home` property.
If they are located elsewhere, the `ReposeValveTest` specification will not work.
However, other utilities provided by the framework may still be used.

== Usage

=== Spock

To make the most of this framework, tests should be written for the Spock testing framework.
The *Repose* functional test framework provides a base Spock `Specification` in the form of the `ReposeValveTest` class.
The `ReposeValveTest` specification provide utilities to populate configuration file templates, start *Repose*, and search the *Repose* log.

The following simple example demonstrates how a Spock test can be written utilizing the *Repose* functional test framework.

[source,groovy]
----
class MyTest extends ReposeValveTest {
    def setupSpec() {
        deproxy = new Deproxy() // <1>
        deproxy.addEndpoint(properties.targetPort) // <2>

        def params = properties.getDefaultTemplateParams() // <3>
        repose.configurationProvider.applyConfigs("common", params) // <4>
        repose.start() // <5>
        repose.waitForNon500FromUrl(properties.reposeEndpoint) //<6>
    }

    def "this is an example test"() {
        when:
        MessageChain mc = deproxy.makeRequest(reposeEndpoint) // <7>

        then:
        mc.receivedResponse.code.toInteger() == 200 // <8>
    }
}
----
<1> Instantiates https://github.com/rackerlabs/deproxy[Deproxy], a proxy testing tool.
<2> Creates a Deproxy endpoint that will act as the origin service for *Repose*.
<3> Retrieves a map of the test properties that will be used in templated configuration files.
<4> Copies configuration files into the test directory being used by the test instance of *Repose*.
Any variables in the configuration files will be substituted.
The variable name will be matched to a key in the `params` map, and the corresponding value will replace the key in the configuration file.
<5> Starts *Repose*.
<6> Waits for *Repose* to finish starting, which is assumed to be when a non-`500` status code response is returned.
<7> Using Deproxy, makes a request to *Repose*.
<8> Asserts that the response status code from *Repose* is `200`.
